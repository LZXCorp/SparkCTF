# Solution (Draft)

1. There is a special slash command in SparkCTF, making use of `/`
2. However, there is a parameter 'key' which can be obtained using 'https://holloway.nz/steg/'
3. The key to use is 'sigauth_0aupti', and the bot will output the flag (output either as an embed or text, with a congrats!).
