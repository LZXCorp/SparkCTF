# Just What's Tampered? - Flag 2
This time, they fired the intern and hired a Senior Software Engineer named Bob. Bob fixed everything and was given a promotion not long after. While Bob enjoyed his pay raise, a rumour has spread about a stolen key and Bob is apparently involved in it. I overheard them talking about a red department.. what is this, Squid Game?
