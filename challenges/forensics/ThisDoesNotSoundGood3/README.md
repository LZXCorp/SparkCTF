# This does not SOUND good - Flag 3

Looks like you want to do the final flag.

Well, guess what? The final flag is actually located inside of the `neon_en_comb.wav` file! \
You might've noticed the password that's stated is wrong, the real password is actually stored inside of `en_track5.wav`.

If you did the previous flag, it is something that is similar to it. If you truly understood what you did for the previous flag, you should be able to do this.

Also, keep in mind that there is a least bit of things that were added to the audio to hide the other half. Don't worry, as long as you can sense the 8 magic numbers, you should be able to do it.

Find it, and get the hidden password for the ZIP file!
