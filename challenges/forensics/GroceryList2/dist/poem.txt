Beneath the Surface: A Tale of Hidden Messages

Drifting through meadows of vibrant wildflowers, she wanders now
Entertaining thoughts of summer days gone by while time
Floating downstream, leaves carried secrets of autumn's glow
Imagining worlds beyond the morning frost and sighing annuli
Nestled among ancient trees, a forgotten cabin stood
Enchanting moonbeams cast silver shadows by alumni
Through the trembling leaves, danced in the breeze until light
Yesterday's memories fade into the ache
Leveraging and navigating through mist-shrouded paths unknown
Obtaining wisdom from the ancient stones amazingly
Northening ever valleys vast, traveling onwards through distant valleys
Seeking adventures in landss unexplored yo
Transcending dawned like morning rays
Shifting sands marked time's endless streets
Underground, containing containers and containers
RUN AWAY RUN AWAY AHHHHHHHH IM NOT GONNA BE... SOS
