1. The [countingflags_2.zip](../dist/countingflags_2.zip) has a crap ton of folders and files, each having one flag, with all flags repeating more than 500.
2. To find the flag, make use of some script that fetches all text files, and finds the flag which appears the least often. The script is provided here: [solve_least.py](./solve_least.py)
