# The Image is a What??? - Flag 4

Now for something more... Mathematical. \
There is a famous sequence that was taught when we all learnt about Sequences and Series back in LOMA.

Concepts like prime numbers are used in encryption techniques like Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and RSA. \
So now, I decided to encrypt the message in the file with the famous sequence by Leonardo.

Can you decrypt it?
