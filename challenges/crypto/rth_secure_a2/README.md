# rth_secure_a - Flag 2

I asked a friend to help me make a better encryption mechanism for my Chat Application (so we can send stuff to each other without people eavesdropping :D).

For more details on how the new algorithm works, look at the `README.md` file.

Hey, here is some info for you since I have no server to run this on :(. \
The public key (n,e) is provided in `secure.txt`.
