# What The Binary - Flag 2

You've proven your decoding skills! Now, it's time to step up your game. In this challenge, you are provided with a file named `binary_cipher.txt`. It is the same 0's and 1's in the file, but bewareâ€”things aren't as straightforward as they seem.

Decoding it normally will give you gibberish. The true flag is hidden behind an extra layer of encryption. Well, it goes back to the long behold question I asked for the first flag:

What is 1 + 1?

Well then again, it isn't ALWAYS plus, there are a lot more Arithmetic / Logic you can do. \
Bitwise operations are the best amirite.
