# Scenery 101

I took this image from my office and found the scenery in front of me really amazing. This place is really cool, with a lot of tall buildings around. Can you guess which MRT station is nearest to my location?

**Flag Format:** \
If the MRT station has a space (e.g., Outram Park), the flag format will be `SIG24{outram_park}`.
