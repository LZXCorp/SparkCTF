# Solution

1. Look around the surrounding and you can see that it is very near the coast of Singapore (Sea around)
2. Notice that there are cargos around which means that the area around must be used for ports.
3. Look at the roads and you can find that roughly 1km - 2km away there is a highway.
4. Tall buildings means that this is either an industrial area or CBD area.
5. The construction literally said Marina Bay.
5. Work around with this clue to find out that I am at Asia Tower 2 taking this photo and the nearest MRT station is Shenton Way :)
