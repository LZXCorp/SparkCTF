# After Macs - Flag 2

I told my pres where I was after I found out where I was. \
We walked till like 10PM or something and then abandoned him after LOL.

Since I was running, I completely forgot to check the Bus Number. \
I accidentally slept in the Bus and ended up in a Bus Interchange

Which Bus Interchange did I end up at?

**Flag Format:** \
Type in the interchange name (first word only) and include a 'interchange' at the end, and replace spacings with '_'. \
SIG24{bedok_interchange}
